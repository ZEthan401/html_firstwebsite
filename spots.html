    <p>These are a few of the many places in NYC and how I feel about them.  I think harbor fitness is good because it is the best gym in Brookyln imo.  I think the Coney Island Amusement Park is good because I made fun memories with friends and family in the past.  I think Time Square is bad because you can do the same things in other places it just won't be as crowded.
