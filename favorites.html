           I like to go to the gym.  Its been about 9 months, and so far Ive gained around 38 pounds (108-148).  Im still very lean and hope to bulk to 170
            <br>I go to the gym 6 days a week and take it very seriously, as it is as much as a priority as school for me.

            <h2>Piano</h2>
            Ive been playing piano for a long time (around 10 years).  I mainly play classical songs but occasionally I like to branch out a play other genres or adaptions of other genres.  Unfortunately, I don't have a lot of time to play anymore because of other priorities including school.
            <br>My favorite classical piece below - Glinka/Balakirev - The Lark
